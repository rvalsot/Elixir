# Project Description

As described in Section 1, Class 3, I'll do a card game that:

* `create_deck`: Creates an array of playing cards
* `shuffle`: Shuffle an array of playing cards
* `deal`: Create a _hand_ of cards
* `contains`: Given a deck and a single card, figures out if the card is in the deck
* `save`: Save a collection of cards to a file on the local machine
* `load`: Load a collection of cards from the local machine

Focus: general design patters with the language
