# Elixir

Personal notes to refer when I'm programming in Elixir.

## Data

__Lists__
``` elixir
[]
```

## Modules

Code in Elixir is organized in different modules of code. They are collections of methods and functions.

Module definition:
``` elixir
defmodule Module_name do
  def method_name do
    "do something"
  end
end
```

### Methods

They have implicit returns.

## Elixir Console

## Mix

Mix:
* Creates Projects
* Compiles Projects
* Run 'Tasks'
* Manages Dependencies

``` shell
# Create a new project
$ mix new project_name

# Running project to iex
project_folder$ iex -S mix
# After this, we can call project with iex
iex()> Module.member
```
